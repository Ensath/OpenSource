Copyright (c) 2016 Simeng Hua

The 2048 game is a simple single-user math game, which consists of a board of 4x4 tiles as its
game space. Each tile may be labeled with a number, which is the power of two. On the initial broad of this game only two tiles marked with number 2 will show. Users can use arrow keys to slide these numbered tiles. When two tiles with same number meet, they will be combined into one tile. The number on the newly generated tile will be the summation of those two numbers. Game will be end once all tiles are marked with numbers or the greatest number shows on all numbered tiles reaches 2048. This project will create an advanced version of the 2048 game, which has two playing modes: the classic timed mode and the endless mode. The highest score of each play will be recorded and generated as a leaderboard on a leaderboard page.
